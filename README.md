# Prime Generator: nÂ²+1 Form Primes and Gap Analysis

A C++ implementation for finding prime numbers of the form $n^2+1$ up to a specified upper bound, with comprehensive prime gap analysis and planned Python visualisation integration.

## Overview

This project generates prime numbers that follow the specific form $n^2+1$ where $n\in\mathbb{Z^+}$. The program efficiently computes all such primes up to a given upper bound and calculates the gaps between consecutive primes in the sequence.

### Mathematical Background

Primes of the form $n^2+1$ are a fascinating subset of prime numbers. While evaluating natural numbers of the form $n^2+1$ is simple, determining which of these are prime presents interesting mathematical challenges. This implementation provides a computational approach to explore these patterns.

## Features

- **Prime Generation**: Efficiently finds all primes of the form $n^2+1$ up to a given bound
- **Gap Analysis**: Calculates gaps between consecutive primes in the sequence
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimised algorithms for handling large upper bounds
- **Array Output**: Prints structured arrays suitable for further analysis
- **Extensible Design**: Prepared for Python integration and visualisation

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm

The program iterates through values of n and:
1. Calculates $n^2+1$ for each $n$
2. Tests primality of the result
3. Stores valid primes in an array
4. Computes gaps between consecutive primes

### Data Structures

- **Prime Array**: Stores all discovered primes of the form $n^2+1$
- **Gap Array**: Contains the differences between consecutive primes
- **Efficient Storage**: Uses appropriate data types for the specified upper bound


## Output Format

The program produces four arrays:

### Prime Array
Contains all primes $p$ up till the upper bound.

### Filtered Prime Array
Contains all primes $p$ where $p = n^2+1$ for some positive integer $n$, with $p \le N$.

### Gap Array  
Contains the differences between consecutive primes: $g_i = p_{i+1} - p_i$


## Performance Considerations

- **Time Complexity**: 
    - Sieve Construction: $O(N\log \log \sqrt{N})$ for the optimised Sieve of Eratosthenes
    - Prime Generation: $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations to check all $k$ where $k^2+1\le N$
    - Gap Calculation: $O(\pi(N))$, where $\pi(N)$ is the number of primes $\le N$
    - Overall Complexity: $O(N\log \log \sqrt{N}+\sqrt{N}+\pi(N))$

- **Space Complexity**: 
    - Sieve Storage: $O(N)$ bits using ``uint8_t`` array and storing only odd numbers
    - Prime Arrays: $O(\pi(N))$ for all primes and $O(\pi_q(N))$ for $(n^2+1)$-type primes
    - Gap Arrays: $O(\pi(N))$ and $O(\pi_q(N))$
    - Total Space: $O(N)$

- **Key Optimisations**:
    - Sieve only up till $\sqrt{N}$
    - Skip even numbers
    - Direct index access ($O(1)$)
    - Odd-only sieve
## Upcoming Features

### Python Integration
- **Data Export**: Export prime and gap arrays to Python-compatible formats
